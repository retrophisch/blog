We’d discovered Frank the year before, when he was one of the opening acts for Social Distortion, and he put on a great show. Then we dove into his music and fell in love with it.</p>\n\n<p>So when Frank got his own headlining tour, we got tickets as soon as was possible.</p>\n\n<p>Frank’s best-known song is “<a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/photosynthesis/id317500956?i=317501094\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Photosynthesis</a>” (iTunes link) and he closed the show with it. This is the edited cut, where I deleted about 5 minutes worth in the middle of the video, of introducing the band and ginning the crowd up.</p>\n\n<p>Please forgive the frequent out-of-focusing; the dim and changing lighting, not to mention the band’s motion on stage, made it difficult for my little Canon point-and-shoot.</p>\n\n<div class=\"attribution\">(<span>Source:</span> <a href=\"https://player.vimeo.com/\">https://player.vimeo.com/</a>)</div>\n",
