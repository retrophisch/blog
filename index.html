			 <p>My friend Pastor Wildman called me up last year, and asked if I would be interested in participating in a music video for a song he was working on. I was immediately in, and when he described the part he envisioned for me, moreso.</p>
<p>The song &ldquo;Wildman&rdquo; is about John the Baptist, and the vision for the video&rsquo;s open was a newscaster noting a developing story about a &ldquo;wild man&rdquo; who was a prophet and a preacher. I put together some rough drafts, there was some back and forth with the Right Good Reverend Wildman, and we hashed out the final details. Then came the time to shoot my video portion.</p>
<p>For that, I turned to my hetero life mate and Empowered Parent Podcast partner, Ryan. He and Kayla have a business, <a href="https://onebighappyhome.com">One Big Happy Home</a>, they do their speaking engagements and trainings under. It&rsquo;s also the umbrella we run the podcast from under, because, no longer being supported by a ministry, we have to pay the hosting bills. (Podcasts ain&rsquo;t free to produce and maintain, folks. And we are <em>very</em> picky about sponsors and what products we might promote.) To that end, they maintain an office with a setup that&rsquo;s great for virtual training and, as it turns out, filming fake news casts.</p>
<p>You may have <a href="https://www.retrophisch.net/2024/01/15/not-quite-ready.html">seen a pair of photos I posted</a> last month, joking that I wasn&rsquo;t ready to say what was going on, but that it had nothing to do with the Iowa caucus, which had actually taken place that day, if memory serves.</p>
<p>Now that Wildman has released the debut single, and if you haven&rsquo;t seen any of my social media posts about it, you can now see my finished work:</p>

</div>

<p>To celebrate the music video debut, and to promote <a href="https://anchormerchandising.com/store/wildman-e-p-pre-order-on-cd-and-digital-download/">pre-ordering the EP</a>, Wildman had me and the other actors—his podcast partner Steve, and our mutual friend Pastor Paul Ahnert—on <a href="https://www.wildmanandsteve.com/podcast/episode/2a2f227e/wildman-cd-release-part-1">The Wildman &amp; Steve Show</a> to talk about how it all got put together. (You can listen to <a href="https://www.wildmanandsteve.com/podcast/episode/28dd86b1/wildman-ep-part-2">Part 2 as well</a>.)</p>
<p>This past Saturday, Wildman had me on his evening show on <a href="http://classicchristianrock.net">Classic Christian Rock Radio</a>, and we talked more about my portion of the video, and how &ldquo;Clark Barr&rdquo; came to be. That interview got turned in to a <a href="https://www.wildmanandsteve.com/podcast/episode/1f66742a/chris-turner">podcast episode</a>.</p>
<p>The interview is more wide-ranging, and the podcast doesn&rsquo;t have the music that was played in between our chats, but the gist of my newscaster persona is this: he&rsquo;s cobbled together from lots of different anchors and other media personalities, as well as a little of myself. The name Clark Barr came first from Superman&rsquo;s alter ego, Clark Kent, and also from a scene in the Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan rom-com <em><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/youve-got-mail">You&rsquo;ve Got Mail</a>.</em> The pair are discussing the online handle &ldquo;ny512,&rdquo; and trying to decipher what the 512 is for.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ryan: &ldquo;Five hundred and twelve people who think he looks like Clark Gable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hanks: &ldquo;Five hundred and twelve people who think he looks like a Clark <strong>bar</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And thus, Clark Barr was born.</p>
<p>So there you have it, my music video debut, and my story behind it. <a href="https://anchormerchandising.com/store/wildman-e-p-pre-order-on-cd-and-digital-download/">Buy Wildman&rsquo;s EP today!</a></p>

		<a href="https://www.retrophisch.net/2024/02/24/retrophisch-review-outlaw.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-02-24 01:28:34 -0500">Feb 24, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I will be honest up front that it is impossible for me to be totally unbiased in this review. I got to know the author, Jack Stewart, a bit before his first book, <em><a href="https://www.retrophisch.net/2023/12/28/draft-retrophisch-review.html">Unknown Rider</a>,</em> was published, and that is documented in the review linked to the just-mentioned title. That said, I respect Jack enough as a writer to not ask for hints and tidbits in our conversations, and he respects me as reader in only offering teasing morsels to whet the reading appetite. We talk more about the business/working side of writing than the content. Which is refreshing, as it allows me to go in with a clean palate.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1648754953/retrophisch-20">Outlaw</a></em> opens about a year after the events of <em>Unknown Rider.</em> Navy fighter pilot Colt Bancroft is back in the cockpit, albeit in a FA-18E Super Hornet stationed aboard the <em>USS Ronald Reagan,</em> instead of the F-35 we first met him in. NCIS Special Agent Emmy “Punky” King is still looking for the traitor within the Navy’s ranks who eluded her in the first book, and her search turns up more questions regarding the Chinese Ministry of State Security’s network of spies on the American West Coast. Her investigation puts her on the scent of a new agent working in southern California, one possibly tied to events in Shanghai that landed a CIA officer in the hands of the Chinese intelligence service.</p>
<p>As Punky realizes the spy she’s after could trigger a synthetic bioweapon breakout, Colt is flying air support for the rescue mission underway to get the CIA’s case officer back. Both come to the realization that if they fail, the implications wouldn’t stop at geopolitical fallout, but the opening of a new world war.</p>
<p><em>Outlaw</em> differs from its predecessor in that Colt and Punky never share the printed page. They think about the other on occasion, but their storylines do not directly intertwine like in <em>Unknown Rider.</em> Nevertheless, each is responsible for massively important parts of the plot, as we are introduced to many fresh faces, as well as one or two others from the first book.</p>
<p>Another key difference is the scope. <em>Unknown Rider</em> dealt with a specific instance that brought the two characters together, whereas in <em>Outlaw,</em> things play out on a much larger scale. To his credit, Jack handles this with deft hands and a tight plot.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.retrophisch.net/2023/12/28/draft-retrophisch-review.html">stated before</a>, Jack’s writing heroes are Tom Clancy and Mark Greaney, the inventor, and one of the current kings, respectively, of the technothriller genre. As a long-time fan of both of those, it gives me great pleasure to say that Jack may have reached the peak of publication and planted his flag with <em>Unknown Rider,</em> but in <em>Outlaw</em> he begins the establishment of his own empire as a technothriller master. This <strong>absolutely</strong> reads like a Clancy novel of old, and it’s an anxiety-filled roller-coaster of a ride in all the best of ways. There are even more subplots and moving parts in this book, and if you thought Jack took you inside the mind of a fighter pilot for a glimpse of life in the cockpit before, brother, the afterburners <strong>really</strong> kick to life in this one.</p>
<p>Let’s just say there may have been a moment during my reading when I texted Jack to curse him out. And I meant it in the most respectful way possible. It&rsquo;s. Just. That. Good.</p>
<p>If you love reading thrillers, stop reading whatever else has your attention at the moment and dive in to <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1648754953/retrophisch-20">Outlaw</a></em>. You won’t regret it.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->My Twitter pal <a href="https://twitter.com/bookstorethor">Trevor</a> has done some great writing on how the Western archetype has been so successful since it&rsquo;s introduction on the silver screen a century ago. One reason for the success of <em>The Mandalorian</em> is it is essentially a Western set in the Star Wars universe. So too, is <em>Firefly</em> nothing more than a space western, something which no doubt aided its success (with viewers, at any rate, the studio not so much). So when Trevor made note of <a href="https://michaelfkane.com/">Michael F. Kane&rsquo;s</a>, novel <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1734172304/retrophisch-20">After Moses</a></em> this past September, I purchased the Kindle version because it sounded intriguing, and though my reading queue is already too deep to add more to, I nevertheless did so. With no regrets.</p>
<p>I was so smitten with the first two chapters that I managed to find a slightly used paperback version, and do not regret that, either. For me, there&rsquo;s something about the printed page, and especially of science fiction novels, since print was all we had back when Michael and I were coming of age. And paperback—though what I read would be referred to today as &ldquo;mass market&rdquo; paperbacks while <em>After Moses</em> is more trade sized—were what all the sci-fi greats I first read in the early &rsquo;80s were available in.</p>
<p>Matthew Cole is from the Arizona Colony on Mars. He&rsquo;s what is known as a freelancer; a captain with a ship looking to collect a paycheck by nearly any means necessary. Nearly, because Cole is a <em>gaucho</em> with a conscience. While on one job, he tangles with another freelancer in an armored exo-suit. She gets the better of him, but they are soon reunited as reluctant partners on another job, one where they are betrayed and left for dead.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s pretty hard to kill a seven-foot-tall woman in an armored suit, and she owes Cole, so they track down the criminals and the one who betrayed them to set things right. Which leads to another job for the pair, and as Cole&rsquo;s broker feeds him more and more jobs, they begin collecting an unlikely crew aboard the ship Cole famously ran solo for a decade. All of whom have secrets they&rsquo;d rather not share, secrets which may or may not hurt themselves, or the others, should things go bad. And with the last job Benny the broker hands them, things could go very bad indeed.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
The world-building—or rather, the solar system-building—Kane has done isn&rsquo;t anything new; readers of the Expanse series will recognize where some of the off-Earth colonies end up, though Kane&rsquo;s seeding of them comes about in a very different way than that of the writing duo known as Jams S.A. Corey. <em>How</em> those colonies got there is also way more entertaining in Kane&rsquo;s novel; humanity had help from an AI.</p>
<p>Moses isn&rsquo;t just any ol' artificial intelligence, however. He is the <em>ultimate</em> artificial intelligence. No one knows where he came from, how he works, or why he&rsquo;s dedicated himself to helping humanity advance, but there he is benevolently doing it. Until the day he isn&rsquo;t. Hence the name of the first novel in the series, also named <em>After Moses.</em></p>
<p>I appreciate Kane&rsquo;s scientific explanations for space travel. This is by no means a &ldquo;hard&rdquo; sci-fi novel, but the frameshift technology actually sounds feasible, given its origin from Moses. The technology doesn&rsquo;t come across to me as <em>Prometheus (Alien)</em>-slick, but feels more like the lived-in-ness George Lucas envisioned for Star Wars. Which isn&rsquo;t surprising, given how influential the latter has been on Kane. It also makes sense, given how scientific progress has slowed, since most of it was outsourced to Moses and now he&rsquo;s gone, as what remains of humanity scrambles to attempt to figure all this wonderful tech he provided out. Things break down, including society, and some if it doesn&rsquo;t get fixed. Which on the societal side, leads to a serious repercussion.</p>
<p>The character of Matthew Cole and his moral compass really resonated with me. We all have favorite characters from the novels we love, but for me, Cole is one of those I wish was a real person I could sit down and have a conversation with. His hard stance—I would even venture, his <em>hatred</em>—toward slavery, very much a real thing in the <em>After Moses</em> universe due to those aforementioned scientific and societal breakdowns, is not only admirable, but something he takes action upon.</p>
<p>All in all, if you love <em>Firefly,</em> <em>The Mandalorian,</em> Westerns, or just really great writing and heroes trying to do the right thing, you will love <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1734172304/retrophisch-20">After Moses</a></em>. Highly recommended.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I would be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t mention the novel I was most excited about this year, and that is <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/164875483X/retrophisch-20">Unknown Rider</a></em>, by my friend Jack Stewart. Jack and I met via Twitter; we both love thrillers and share favorite authors. I met Jack in person, along with <a href="https://www.wardlarsen.com">Ward Larsen</a> and <a href="https://www.davidmccloskeybooks.com">David McCloskey</a>, at one of <a href="https://donbentleybooks.com">Don Bentley</a>&rsquo;s book signings in Dallas. We would meet up again at two of <a href="https://officialjackcarr.com">Jack Carr</a>&rsquo;s signings. A former Naval aviator, with 23 years as a fighter pilot under his belt, Jack also graduated from the famous TOPGUN Fighter Weapons School. In a word, he <strong>knows</strong> what he&rsquo;s talking about.</p>
<p>While on a routine night flight in his F-35C Joint Strike Fighter, Colt Bancroft is routed to check out mysterious lights which are orbiting above and around one of the escort cruisers in his aircraft carrier&rsquo;s strike group. As Colt arrives on station, his  aircraft fails to respond to his control; nothing he does in the cockpit can keep it from rolling inverted—that&rsquo;s upside down for us non-pilots—and nosediving down directly at the cruiser. At the last moment, the F-35 veers away from the cruiser and Colt regains control of his aircraft. But not his reputation.</p>
<p>Now deemed a threat to his fellow naval crewmen, and looking at the career he fought so hard for slipping away through no fault of his own, Colt begins his own investigation into what happened that night. He finds himself teaming up with a NCIS agent in the middle of her own hunt for a traitor selling secrets to the enemy, and the two realize not only have their paths intertwined, but the people they are looking for are one and the same. Not knowing who they can fully trust, the pair stumble in to a much bigger, and more dangerous, gambit.</p>
<p>Given my friendship with Jack, it&rsquo;s impossible for me to be 100% impartial in reviewing <em>Unknown Rider</em>, but as <a href="https://x.com/retrophisch/status/1687995386873450496">I pored over an Advanced Reader Copy while, appropriately enough, flying</a>, I could tell he was on to something with his debut. <a href="https://markgreaneybooks.com">Mark Greaney</a>, one of Jack&rsquo;s writing heroes, nailed it when he said, &ldquo;Strongly evocative of classic Clancy,&rdquo; and Mark would know <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0425248607/retrophisch-20">a thing</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0425275132/retrophisch-20">or two</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0425279774/retrophisch-20">about</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0399176810/retrophisch-20">Tom Clancy novels</a>. And that&rsquo;s just it: if, like us, you grew up loving Tom Clancy, Stephen Coonts, and Dale Brown novels, you will <strong>love</strong> <em>Unknown Rider.</em> It carries the same spirit and multiple plot lines those authors became famous for. It is definitely recommended, and I can&rsquo;t wait to see what Colt and Punky get up to next.</p>
<p>5/5 phins, a great debut</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Some times, the Kindle Daily Deal email can really deliver, and one day this month, it did with Alan Dean Foster&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFB646K6/retrophisch-20">Montezuma Strip</a>. A collection of short stories originally published in 1995, it focuses on an imagined USA-Mexico border a century in the future. Here, &ldquo;stretching from the Pacific to the Gulf of Mexico,&rdquo; is the center of techno-industrialization for the world. Like any such place, where there&rsquo;s industry, there&rsquo;s greed, and where there&rsquo;s greed, there&rsquo;s crime. And crime is the industry Angel Cardenas works in.</p>
<p>Cardenas is a Tex-Mex federal cop based out of Nogales. He is also an &ldquo;Intuit.&rdquo; Born with a heightened intuition, he is something of a living lie detector. Angel is able to pick up the subtle visual and audible cues we all give off, but rarely glean from others, and this, coupled with his experience and his own logical thinking, makes him a damn good officer. One who is in much demand when crimes in other districts are beyond the ken of local law enforcement.</p>
<p>From figuring out how two software designers were killed, or in Foster&rsquo;s parlance, &ldquo;vacuumed,&rdquo; to infiltrating a protection racket masquerading as a religious order, Cardenas has his hands full in a world where First World technology butts up against Third World labor practices.</p>
<p>I found the world Foster created fascinating, on par with those built by Gibson, Sterling, Stephenson, Rucker, and others in the 1980s and &rsquo;90s. If you&rsquo;ve ever read those authors' dystopian science fiction works, you&rsquo;ll feel right at home in the Montezuma Strip. Angel Cardenas reads to me like a prototype for Steven Kotler&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1250202078/retrophisch-20">Lion Zorn</a>. Given the current socio-political situation on the US-Mexico border, and the deteriorating relationship with China as an economic partner, Foster&rsquo;s work from nearly two decades ago doesn&rsquo;t sound as far-fetched as it might have when first published.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a fan of Alan Dean Foster, cyberpunk-style sci-fi, or just good characters and great writing in general, you won&rsquo;t be disappointed with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFB646K6/retrophisch-20">Montezuma Strip</a>.</p>
<p>5/5 phins, I loved it.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m behind on my book reviews, so here&rsquo;s looking back at my first read of the year. Consequently, my first six books of the year were all Advance Reader Copies (ARCs), and they started with a bang in Connor Sullivan&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1982166428/retrophisch-20"><em>Wolf Trap</em></a>. That shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising, since his Barry Award-winning debut, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1982166398/retrophisch-20"><em>Sleeping Bear</em></a>, was absolutely terrific. <em>Wolf Trap</em> features a different set of protagonists than <em>Sleeping Bear</em>, but I do hope he revisits the first novel&rsquo;s characters in the future.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here, Brian Rhome is working the ski slopes in Montana, wrestling with his personal demons, and contemplating suicide. When the current president&rsquo;s green energy plans are sabotaged, Rhome is recalled to his former life—the one responsible for all those aforementioned demons—in CIA&rsquo;s Ground Branch. For not only have the president&rsquo;s plans, and the new power plants connected to those plans, been sabotaged, but a larger threat looms that requires Brian&rsquo;s particular set of skills.</p>
<p><em>Wolf Trap</em> is certainly a different kind of thriller than Connor&rsquo;s debut, and truth be told, it took a little while for me to get over that particular hang-up. Once I got past that, however, everything fell into place and this reader was off to the races. Which is something our hero Brian is doing as well, racing around the globe to thwart the schemes of the man responsible for those demons which had Rhome contemplating stepping off a cliff when we first met him.</p>
<p>Sullivan doesn&rsquo;t get bogged down with any details on the green science involved, delivering just what&rsquo;s needed for the reader to understand what&rsquo;s going on, and what the stakes are. While Rhome isn&rsquo;t an everyman in the sense that not all of us have served in the CIA&rsquo;s covert teams, he is in that we can all relate in some way to the loss and pain he grapples with, making it very easy to root and care for him. Connor definitely has another hit on his hands, and thriller readers <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1982166428/retrophisch-20">should dive into <em>Wolf Trap</em></a> if they haven&rsquo;t done so already.</p>
<p>4/5 phins, a solid sophomore release</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> The best conspiracy theories contain an element of truth, and the best novels containing conspiracies do as well. Such is the case with Ryan Steck&rsquo;s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1496462866/retrophisch-20">Fields of Fire</a></em>, the debut novel from the founder of <a href="https://therealbookspy.com">The Real Book Spy</a>, one of the Web&rsquo;s go-to resources for thriller lovers.</p>
<p>Matthew Redd is doing not only what he loves, but something he is good at as well: being a Marine Raider, part of the tip of the spear that is America&rsquo;s special operations forces. With nods to the characters of Vince Flynn, Lee Child, Brad Taylor, and others, Redd is a hard-charging Marine with a heart of gold, both thanks to his adoptive father, J.B. But while gearing up for the takedown mission of a scientist-terrorist, Redd is deceived by the person he helps out on the side of the road, and the result is his being disgracefully drummed out of his beloved Corps. To make matters worse, he emerges from the stockade to find out J.B. has died.</p>
<p>Redd sets off to his home in Montana, to the small town and open spaces he hasn&rsquo;t been around in for close to a decade. He finds himself at odds with his neighbor, the son of a BigTech billionaire, learns his high school sweetheart has returned, and can&rsquo;t square the messages he&rsquo;s getting about J.B.&rsquo;s death with the man himself. Not getting any help from local law enforcement, Redd sets out to get answers using the skills taught to him by J.B. and the Marine Corps.</p>
<p>Ryan Steck enters an already crowded thriller field, but brings something fresh and new in the story of Matty Redd. As not only a lover of the thriller genre, but a student, Steck has learned his lessons well and crafted a solid debut. Incorporating bits of real life, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Guidestones">Georgia Guidestones</a> and Bill Gates <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/05/bill-gates-climate-crisis-farmland">buying up farmland</a>, albeit in this case his fictitious tech billionaire being the buyer, Steck weaves a conspiracy of global proportions into the rough-and-tumble locale of Big Sky life in Montana.</p>
<p>Steck signed a two-book deal with his publisher, and the next novel is easily but convincingly set up at the conclusion of this one. As an adoptive father myself, I could feel J.B.&rsquo;s pain and pride as Redd recounted lessons his dad had taught him. I also enjoyed the carefully-laid plot twist. If you are a lover of the thriller genre, this is a great read to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1496462866/retrophisch-20">add to your library</a>.</p>
<p>4/5 phins, a solid debut</p>

<p>My niece-by-choice Tori put her considerable art skills to work with a drawing she did of Kelly and Luis, which they both loved. And have you ever been chased down by the lead singer of a band to sign her jacket? Tori has.</p>
<p>This band&rsquo;s appreciation of its fans continues to amaze me. Go see them!</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Let&rsquo;s be clear about one thing right up front: I fully admit I am not an impartial reviewer of this book. Please allow me to explain.</p>
<p>My interests when it comes to reading fiction, like many, took a meandering path through my formative years. Thanks to <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Star Wars<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->—yes, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was the name of the movie when it came out, none of this retcon naming nonsense—on the big screen when I was six, science fiction was an early staple of my childhood reading. When I was in seventh grade, I came down with chicken pox. Looking forward to a couple of weeks home from school, I sat in the car while my mother went into the school to talk with the front office about getting assignments from my teachers. Then, and God bless her for this amongst so much more, Mom went down the hall to the library, to get me a couple of books. After a discussion with the librarian about what I liked, she came back out with a set of books that changed my life in many ways: Tolkien&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Hobbit<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Lord of the Rings<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>When I was 15, my dad brought home a paperback from a debut novelist: Tom Clancy&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Hunt for Red October<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Star Wars<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Lord of the Rings<!-- raw HTML omitted --> before it, this was another pivotal moment in expanding my reading horizon. These three still remain to this day: science fiction, fantasy, and thrillers. Oh, and did I mention that thanks to Tolkien and being at a middle school full of other nerds, I started playing <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dungeons &amp; Dragons<!-- raw HTML omitted -->?<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Well now I have.</p>
<p>So when a novel comes along that combines two of these elements, the military thriller, with fantasy/D&amp;D, and does so very, very well, it is a no-brainer that I am going to love it. And such is the case with <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Forgotten Ruin<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Take a crack Army unit, throw them a few thousand years into our future, into a Europe disfigured and rearranged by a cataclysmic event which led to the very rearranging of DNA amongst the populace, so that races previously thought of as only fantasy, elves and orcs, are now a reality, and have these Rangers deal with it. Authors Jason Anspach and Nick Cole bill it as &ldquo;Tolkien meets Shock and Awe.&rdquo; They have crafted a real gem from a firecracker of an idea, and the execution is flawless from start to finish.</p>
<p>The story is told through Talker, a Ranger-come-lately. Talker is called Talker by the other Rangers because he&rsquo;s a translator, speaks lots of languages, and not knowing exactly what situation the spec ops units being sent forward in time might encounter, the higher-ups figured it might be good to have some folks attached who can help out in case our heroes end up in a non-English-speaking realm. What the higher-ups don&rsquo;t account for, as we learn from Talker, is just how far in the future they end up.</p>
<p>Ever wonder what the Battle of Helm&rsquo;s Deep might have been like if Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Théoden, and the Rohirrim had machine guns to use against Saruman&rsquo;s horde? You&rsquo;ll get a taste of that and more in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Forgotten Ruin.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> And what about the other units that went through, what happened to them? Talker and his Ranger buddies learn some lessons about them the hard way and seek not to repeat others.</p>
<p>The world Anspach and Cole have created, that of a modern military unit being cast into a medieval-style past/future/alternate reality, is nothing new under the sun, but their choices and execution of same render this nothing short of a masterpiece in the space. Is that too gushing of a sentiment? Tough. I told you at the outset I could not be impartial with this one.</p>
<p>Simply put: if you love military thrillers, if you love sword-and-sorcery fantasy, you will love <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Forgotten Ruin.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Grab yourself a copy<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, Ranger Up with Talker and the gang, remember to Be Meaner Than It, and enjoy a great read.</p>

<p>So my experimentation with Ghost as a new blogging platform is, for now at least, dead. My conclusion: I didn&rsquo;t want to be stuck running the behind-the-scenes of another blogging platform, which is what I was doing with my own installation of Ghost on DigitalOcean. And yet I didn&rsquo;t want to pony up for a Ghost Pro installation while I would still be paying for my existing setup, where I have more than just this blog and email.</p>
<p>So for now, staying put with WordPress on Dreamhost. My installation is pretty lean as it is, and I&rsquo;m used to it. I do plan to migrate from the .com to the .net, because it just fits with the online moniker.</p>
<p>If you are new to blogging, however, and are looking for a fast, easy to use, and worry-free platform, I would recommend giving <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ghost<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a look. Should my needs change in the future where I think they would best be served by moving to Ghost Pro, that is definitely the direction I would move.</p>

For me, he was very gracious with his time when we met once outside Alex Box Stadium, while my oldest was on the field for the 2014 baseball camp, when he said hello, asked how I was doing, and how my son was enjoying camp. And he was gracious in posing for photos with all the camp participants as well.</p>

			 <p>In his debut novel, Don Bentley introduced the world to Matt Drake, a new kind of thriller hero, yet one still recognizable to fans of the genre. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Without Sanction<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> was a runaway bestseller, and I was glad to have followed the advice of so many on social media and give it a read. Drake takes the next step on his journey in the follow-up, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Outside Man<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I’ll be honest: I loved this book. In a private message exchange, I told Bentley I thought this was his <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Empire Strikes Back<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Star Wars<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Without Sanction.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The first novel sets the stage, but this one <!-- raw HTML omitted --> turns the volume all the way to 11 and takes Matt Drake, and his creator, to the next level.</p>
<p>After the events of the first book, this one opens with Matt being ambushed in broad daylight, on the streets of Austin, Texas, no less. There is a terrorist with a score to settle against Drake, backed up by professionals from the Middle East. Our hero manages to survive, but the ambush provides more questions than answers, and Drake is once again plunged into a world he thought he was desperate to leave, but finds his soul needs for him to truly be a part of. The villain we caught whispers of in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Without Sanction<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is fully revealed here, and he is formidable. Worse, he knows exactly where to hurt Matt Drake the most.</p>
<p>One of the things I appreciate about Drake, and Bentley’s writing of him, is that he is fully human. He gets hurt, wounded, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->injured,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and those have real-world consequences that affect how Matt continues his mission. Coupled with his vow to rescue an innocent from a sex-trafficking ring, and his snarky sense of humor, on more than one occasion one is left wondering, “Just how is Matt going to get out of trouble this time?“ As a thriller author, this is exactly what you want in your toolbox, to keep your readers on their toes and guessing what’s next.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Without Sanction<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was a firm entry into the thriller genre for Don Bentley, but <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Outside Man<!-- raw HTML omitted --> vaults him into the band of my must-read authors, joining Daniel Silva, Mark Greaney, Lee (and now Andrew) Child, Nick Petrie, and Jack Carr. If you’re a fan of the genre, or just someone looking for a great read, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Outside Man<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a must-buy<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>Much has been made of the latest Jack Reacher novel, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Sentinel<!-- raw HTML omitted -->,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> due to its collaborative nature between Lee Child and his brother, Andrew Child neé Grant. After 24 Jack Reacher novels, Lee Child felt it was time to step away from the yearly grind of write, publish, promote, and begin enjoying a well-deserved retirement. However, knowing the love fans have for Reacher, Child didn’t want to simply end the series, and enlisted his brother Andrew Grant to take up the mantle. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Sentinel<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is the first of three planned collaborations before Andrew takes on the series solo.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I discovered Jack Reacher—Child’s former Army MP now wandering vigilante—three years after the first book, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Killing Floor<!-- raw HTML omitted -->,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was published. I quickly blew through <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Killing Floor,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Die Trying<!-- raw HTML omitted -->,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tripwire<!-- raw HTML omitted -->,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and began, like so many other readers, the annual wait for a new Jack Reacher novel to devour. While there are some notable differences with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Sentinel<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from prior Reacher tomes, devouring this one was no different from the rest.</p>
<p>Reacher takes himself to Nashville, to listen to good music, which in and of itself is a nod to Reacher’s past, as well as Lee Child’s as Reacher’s creator. The reason Reacher ends up in Margrave, Georgia in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Killing Floor<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is he’s seeking out the home town of a blues man he likes. Reacher, being Reacher, gets involved in sticking up for the little guy in helping a local band, and finds he quickly needs to leave town. He ends up not too far away in Pleasantville, Tennessee. On the streets of the town completely by chance when a daylight abduction is attempted, Reacher thwarts the kidnapping and gets involved in a matter that runs deeper than it first appears, one with implications reaching far beyond the town itself.</p>
<p>There is certainly a different feel with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Sentinel<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from previous Reacher novels, the result of the collaboration between the brothers. Some reviewers have complained about the tone, or that there is too much expository from Reacher. I didn’t notice much of a change in that regard. As usual, there is ample opportunity for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Reacher to say nothing<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. What stood out to me is that the novel didn’t feel as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tight<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as previous efforts. One of the many things that has made the Reacher novels so popular is that Child’s writing style was as sparse as the main character’s wardrobe. It was a perfect marriage of style and character, and there is something of a departure from that in this latest book.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I did not find it distracting to the point of losing enjoyment. Reacher is still sticking up the little guy, still mucking up the best-laid plans of those who wish ill on others, still being, well, Reacher. This was a learning process for the brothers, and I expect the next two Reacher novels will get better and better as Andrew establishes himself as the main author in taking on the sole responsibility for an annual Reacher story. While <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Sentinel<!-- raw HTML omitted --> won’t vault into my Reacher top five, it is a solid entry in the Jack Reacher universe.</p>

			 <p>The 2014 Nic Cage film, <em>Dying of the Light,</em> isn&rsquo;t great, but does have a component that makes it worth watching. My review: <a href="https://www.retrophisch.com/2020/11/15/retrophisch-review-dying-of-the-light/">www.retrophisch.com/2020/11/1&hellip;</a></p>

			 <p>There are some roles which actors are born to play. There are some actors for whom roles are specifically written. Then there are those actors who perfectly fit a role you might not think before seeing them in said role would be that perfect fit. Nicholas Cage certainly fills this latter category in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dying of the Light.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I came across this 2014 film, billed as a psychological thriller, while channel surfing. It was about fifteen minutes in, but my TiVo still had those previous fifteen minutes, the description sounded interesting, so I hit record to make sure I got the whole thing, and started from the beginning. While the film has some slow parts, which seems to be such to stretch out the running time to 90 minutes more than anything else, all in all I enjoyed it.</p>
<p>Cage is Evan Lake, a longtime and highly decorated CIA agent. We are introduced to him as he has a flashback to a covert operation in Africa where is captured and tortured by an Islamic terrorist, Muhammad Banir. Among the other tortures, Lake has part of an ear mutilated. An extraction team intervenes before he can be killed, killing several of the terrorists, presumably including Banir. Lake doesn’t believe Banir is dead, and carries this belief with him while he continues working in the Agency for another 22 years. Just as the CIA is made aware of the possibility that Banir may be still alive, Lake learns he has frontotemporal dementia, the side effects of which…well, let’s just say they play perfectly into Nic Cage’s acting abilities and the type of roles he is more well known for.</p>
<p>Milton Schultz, aptly played by Anton Yelchin, is an analyst for the CIA who is a close friend of Lake’s. There is clearly a teacher-protege relationship going on, and Milt is quite fond of Lake. That fondness grows into protection as Lake reveals his condition to Milt. Due to the onset of the dementia, Lake is forcibly retired from the CIA, but with Milt’s help, undergoes one last mission to take out Banir in Africa.</p>
<p>The film’s production value reminded me of Cinemax’s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Strike Back<!-- raw HTML omitted --> series, of which I’m a fan. It’s not big budget, but it gets the job done. The film itself is not without controversy, in that the studio re-edited and scored the film without writer/director Paul Schrader’s permission or input. Cage and Yelchin stood by Schrader in disavowing the finished film, and given the slow and disjointed points in the movie, I can understand why. When as a creative individual you put effort into a project, a project for which you have a distinct vision, and that is taken away from you while you have no legal recourse, well, I can understand Schrader’s frustration. He would go on to recut the movie to as close as possible to his original vision from DVD copies of the workprint. That version of the film, which he called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dark,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> can presumably be found on BitTorrent sites.</p>
<p>I do not plan to hunt that down, as I do not think it would greatly change my overall impression of the film, nor elevate what I believe is its greatest strength: the relationship between Lake and Milt.</p>
<p>In a world where masculine friendship and filial love has been minimized, it was refreshing to watch one friend go to the lengths Milton does to help someone he cares about, admires, and loves. Time and again, Milt makes sacrifices great and small for Lake, doing what he can to help his mentor fulfill his final mission. The conversations between the two of them are the glue of the film, and the scenes I enjoyed most.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dying of the Light<!-- raw HTML omitted --> can be a little slow, it won’t be for everyone, and I was never on the edge of my seat as with some thrillers. But it makes up for its downsides with a story of friendship, sacrifice, and love that I found compelling enough to recommend it for that part of the plot.</p>

			 <p>There is some real gallows humor, some nearly off the rails, in the Liam Neeson vehicle, <em>Cold Pursuit.</em> It&rsquo;s certainly not high cinema, nor even the best among Neeson&rsquo;s post-Taken, debt-repayment movies. I enjoyed it much more than I thought I would.</p>

The heavily obscured project, Prometheus, has taken a turn for the worse: on an abandoned oil rig off the coast of Alaska, scientists have begun injecting human subjects, and not just any human subjects. These are the worst of the worst: rapists, serial killers, death row inmates. Sound familiar, readers of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Passage<!-- raw HTML omitted -->?</p>
<p>Yet Reardon has his own twist on what happens to the test subjects, one that comes across as far more believable than Cronin&rsquo;s vampires, but is just as terrifying. Defying the odds to escape from Chinese imprisonment, Karl joins forces with Tom Reese, the protagonist from Reardon&rsquo;s first book, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Prometheus Man<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I should note that I hadn&rsquo;t read this first novel before diving in to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Dark Continent<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but it was not an issue. Reardon gives enough backstory from the first book sprinkled throughout the second to get you up to speed and keep you engaged. After the test subjects escape, Karl and Tom must enter the heart of darkness the killers have created in middle America to take down the enhanced humans before they end life as we have become accustomed to it.</p>
<p>This was probably not the best choices of books to read during a pandemic and the inherent fears that go along with one, but I could not put it down. It is a &ldquo;just because we can do something doesn&rsquo;t mean we should&rdquo; thriller that grabs hold of you and doesn&rsquo;t let go. From the beginning, I was deeply invested in Karl and Tom, and Kronin (a nod to Justin Cronin?) has to be one of the scariest fiction characters since Cormac McCarthy&rsquo;s Chigurh. Reardon has crafted an engaging, suspenseful story that should make one think while being entertained.</p>
<p>4.5/5 fins, definitely recommended</p>

			 <p>I help administer a private group on Facebook for foster and adoptive dads, and posted this today for encouragement, because I needed it myself:</p>
<p>So lately I&rsquo;ve been struggling with the strong wills of my boys, and of my own. The constant tug-of-war. My wife and I were talking about it over lunch today, because she shares in the frustration (she&rsquo;s strong-willed as well), and I reminded her, as much as myself, that they act this way because they feel securely attached to us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it would be nice if they weren&rsquo;t complete <!-- raw HTML omitted -->JERKS<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about it!&rdquo; she sighed. She didn&rsquo;t use the word &ldquo;jerks,&rdquo; but I&rsquo;m trying to keep this family-friendly.</p>
<p>I mention this because I know I&rsquo;m not alone in being a dad frustrated with the behaviors of his kids from hard places. Especially when they&rsquo;ve been in our home for so long (birth for two of them, 9 months old for the third, and they&rsquo;re 16, 11, and 8 now), and it just doesn&rsquo;t feel like things are getting better.</p>
<p>Then God decides to plant a reminder on you in an unexpected way. In an email newsletter unrelated to parenting, there was this verse of encouragement from Hebrews, &ldquo;I will never leave you or forsake you.&rdquo; God always has our back, and we just need to go to Him with our frustrations, seek His peace.</p>
<p>And because I&rsquo;m an &rsquo;80s metalhead, this verse and the feeling behind it will always be enshrined for me in the opening song from Rage of Angels' self-titled, 1989, debut album:</p>

			 <p>It is not hyperbole to say the Flower Mound location of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->El Chico<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has been very important in my life and that of my family. I have been going there since before my children were born. The first time Kelly and I ate there, we hadn’t yet bought a house in Flower Mound. We stopped in for dinner while driving around the town, getting a feel for it as we started the house-hunting process in the fall of 2001.</p>
<p>It cannot be understated how it affected me and the boys when it closed over a month ago, while we were in Colorado. “Where are we going to go on Thursday nights now?” our youngest asked. (More on that in a moment.) It was something Kelly and I figured was coming—again, more on that in a moment—but it still surprised me when it finally happened.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>What cemented my relationship with the restaurant was an incident that occurred in 2003, before our oldest was born. We had been coming to get our Tex-Mex fix there often, but not yet to the point where I would consider us “regulars”. The fact was, it was the closet Tex-Mex restaurant to our then still-new house, and was easy to get to. But on that night in 2003, we walked in, and one of the cooks was turning over chicken breasts on the grill. This location had an open-to-the-public kitchen. You could literally walk right up to one of the grills, separated from it only by an eight-inch thick counter, and watch them work. The smoke generated by the turning of the chicken wafted out and over the waiting area, and my pregnant wife turned to me and said, “We have to go. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->” And she turned around and left. I followed.</p>
<p>It would be months, maybe even years, before she set foot in there again. Whatever pregnancy-hormone weirdness had affected her that night imprinted a feeling of nausea on her whenever she thought about El Chico.</p>
<p>So I started going by myself.</p>
<p>Shortly after our oldest was born, I lost my job. It was the first of many rounds of layoffs to hit the newly-formed Verizon, and it was, from a financial and incentive standpoint, the best round to have been in. I miss the people I worked with, though I have managed to remain friends with a few. I don’t regret getting laid off.</p>
<p>For one, I became a stay-at-home dad. And that allowed me to start going to lunch at El Chico whenever I liked, which shortly became a weekly occurrence. Through the vagaries of restaurant seating priorities, I eventually came to have a regular server, Kim. It reached the point where I would either ask to be seated in her section, or she would see me walk in and seat me herself or inform the hostess to put me at one of her tables. Some times, I would be seated in her section, and the first time I would see her, she would be bringing me an iced tea and informing me she’d already put my order in. In those days, I tended to get the same dish every time I came in. The dish was called the Manzanillo on the menu. It was a crispy taco with ground beef, a cheese and onion enchilada, a chicken enchilada, and sides of Mexican rice and refried beans. This was my staple.</p>
<p>Years went by, and as is the case in the restaurant business, changes ensued. One was that the Manzanillo disappeared from the menu. Fear not, Kim told me, for it’s still in the computer, and the kitchen staff all still know what it is. I continued ordering it, even after Kim moved on to (hopefully) bigger and better things, and new servers were hired. “What’s that?” they would ask, confused when I ordered it. “Don’t worry,” I’d reply, “it’s in the computer.” Sure enough, they’d come back confirming it was so, and I kept getting my favorite dish.</p>

<p>Eventually, our oldest outgrew baby and toddler food, and we began ordering off the kids menus when we went out. It was no different at El Chico, except that on Thursdays, kids meals—the $4.99 ones—were 99 cents. Not just at night, but all day. So Thursdays became the day we ate at El Chico. My boy could get a quesadilla, rice and beans, and a beverage, all for a buck. Oh that this same child could eat so cheaply today; he’s sixteen, and has all of the appetite such an age entails for the male of the species.</p>
<p>This continued as Boy2 was added to the family, and because of our regularity, we got to know James, the assistant manager, and Tonya, the general manager. They celebrated birthdays with us, and the adoption and homecoming of Boy3 when that happened in 2011. The first place I wanted to go the day after we got back from Rwanda, after being on the African continent for nearly a month, was El Chico. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The salsa content of my bloodstream had gotten dangerously low.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Our youngest, who had had mushed avocado first in his home country, then again in Kenya while we awaited his U.S. visa, continued to eat it when we got slices at El Chico. He’s not so much into it today, at age eight, as then, but it remains, to me at least, a reminder that it was the first food I associate with Tex-Mex he ate both at his first home and his current one.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The boys grew older, started school, but every Thursday night, if we were in town and didn’t have any other engagements, we were at El Chico, where I could feed all three boys for three dollars. “Miss Tonya” would spoil them on occasion, bringing, instead of the cherry Jell-O included with their kids meals, vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup, and not charging us extra. James would always stop by our table and check on us if he was working. We had a bevy of servers, male and female, who recognized our family on sight, and even if we weren’t in their section, would stop by to say hi. They would go out of their way to help new servers with us. It was a place of comfort for us. Tonya and James helped our Cub Scout pack sell popcorn at the car show event the restaurant sponsored. We talked about partnering on a school backpack drive for underprivileged kids, but our pack—and I take full responsibility for this—never got it off the ground.</p>
<p>I first met in person <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Paul<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Greg<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, creators of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tweetbot<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Drafts<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, respectively, two apps I use daily, at El Chico. Both were local to me, Paul moreso, living in the same town but on the south side while we were on the north. I invited them to lunch and to watch a WWDC keynote together, and they accepted. While not a developer myself, I was keenly interested in their take on such announcements, they having a different perspective of such than a regular user like me. This became at the least a yearly occurrence, at times one of them being unable to make it, and our being joined by other Mac nerds or developers in the area, including once or twice my friend <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Patrick<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, before he went to work for Apple, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dave<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, before he went to work for Amazon.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I couldn’t tell you how many meals the hetero life mate, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Brent<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and I had there. When he was working at the nearby church we attended, we were easily meeting for lunch a couple of times a month. Or when he was getting a vehicle serviced at the Driver’s Edge franchise two doors down. A lot of our friendship was cemented at the tables of El Chico. Frustrations shared, advice offered (mostly by him), lots of laughter and talk of music, bands, concerts. Would the Rangers <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ever<!-- raw HTML omitted --> get a pitching staff to complement the offense? (Yes, for two glorious seasons, though they fell short of the ultimate prize.) The similarities and differences of our college experiences (LSU for me, Auburn for him, and four years before mine), mutual hatred for the Crimson Tide. Can the Stars get back to the Stanley Cup Finals? Prayers for our marriages, prayers for our kids, sharing of our children’s triumphs and failures, our spouses’ ups and downs. The two of us had great times there for the better part of a decade.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>And every Thursday night, if we were in town and not otherwise engaged, the family was there for kids’ night.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When the teenager asked the other day why the restaurant closed, one of the things I told him was, “The only constants are death and change.” Nowhere is this more true than the restaurant business.</p>
<p>I’ll be honest: when it comes to Tex-Mex food, El Chico’s hasn’t been the tops. It’s good, but not great. I like Blue Goose’s quesadillas and brisket tacos better. I like Cristina’s salsa and rice way, way, way better. I like El Fenix’s enchiladas better. But because of its proximity, compared to all of the others, it was where we landed first and most often. At some point, the Manzanillo was removed from the computer, too. Not to worry, I was assured. I could basically order the same dish, just order a two-enchilada plate and add a taco a la carte. It was slightly more expensive than the Manzanillo had been on its own, but it was worth it to keep my dining experience the same.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>About four years ago, the first signs of trouble began. The staff turnover was tremendous. They couldn’t keep anyone for long. There were a couple who stuck, like Felipe, who became one of our favorites, and was with the restaurant until the very end. (More on him in a moment, too.) There was the young lady, whose name I cannot remember, but wish I could, whose first language was Spanish, not English, though you wouldn’t know it to listen to her. She was delighted to find out Boy2 was learning Spanish in elementary school, and would work with him on pronunciation during her trips to our table. Finally, there was Sam, a friendly, affable young man who shared a first name with one of our kids. We became regulars of his, too, and our kids loved interacting with him.</p>
<p>Tonya told us James was in an auto accident, and the next week he was back at work, in a walking boot. The boys asked him how he was feeling every time they saw him after that. James told me stories about going out to eat with his friends, and how he more and more didn’t like going out to other restaurants. He felt he and Tonya had a great system working at this El Chico location, that that was one of the reasons it had survived for so long when other locations had closed. He could feel out how things were set up and working at other restaurants, and it wasn’t like what they had going. After those conversations with him, I could tell what he meant when we went other places.</p>
<p>Tonya had shoulder surgery, and our kids would ask about her and fuss over her when she came back with her arm in a sling. She asked our oldest about hockey, Boy2 about swimming, Boy3 about basketball and hip-hop. Kelly and I would ask her about her physical therapy, and getting back to “normal”. Tonya was very frustrated that she wasn’t personally operating at peak efficiency. She really cared about her restaurant, and the staff she’d been entrusted with.</p>
<p>It was Tonya who told us about the sale, and that she was losing her job. Corporate had decided to divest itself of underperforming locations, turning them into franchises rather than close them outright. The owner of the Cantina Laredo in nearly Lewisville bought our El Chico, and brought in a friend in the business to run it, ousting Tonya. James had seen the writing on the wall months earlier and left for greener pastures. That was two years ago.</p>
<p>Last year, when Patrick was in town from California, he was trying to eat out at all the places he missed from living here. One of those places was El Chico, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->we met up at the Flower Mound location for a late dinner<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. We closed the place down, and the gracious staff allowed us some extra time to visit and catch up.</p>
<p>In the end, whatever had ailed our location for so long proved to be insurmountable. Sam left, and we learned from a close friend that he ended up at another restaurant, one that isn’t in danger of folding any time soon. It should allow him a steady income while he finishes school. I ran into Felipe at Cantina Laredo when I stopped in for a solo dinner after a meeting. I wasn’t put at one of his tables, but after learning we had a relationship, my server turned me over to him. He had been on his way to work the week before when the owner had called him, told him he was closing our El Chico location. But he didn’t want to lose him as a worker, and he should go to Cantina Laredo instead. Two days of training on the different menu and systems, and he was back on the floor full time.</p>
<p>The weekend we returned from Colorado, Paul asked me on Twitter: “Did El Chico shut down?” I told him yes, and that I was overwhelmed with grief. He replied that this had totally ruined his lunch plans. I may have used some hyperbole about being overwhelmed with grief, but the sense of loss was and remains real.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We moved two and a half years ago, a mile and a half from our old house, and there’s a year-old Tex-Mex place within walking distance we really like. The boys haven’t eaten there nearly as much as Kelly and I have. They have a kids menu, but not a kids night, and with the teenager off kids menus anyway, we have to save our pennies when it comes to going out.</p>
<p>I have James and Tonya’s phone numbers, back from when we were planning stuff with our old Cub Scout pack. I’ve texted with them since they each left, but it’s been months since the last communication, and I’m not sure what any of us would say now about the closing that wasn’t already said between us.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for the landlord to take down the El Chico sign. It was there the weekend we got back from Colorado, and before the week was out, it was gone. Only those of us who have lived here for a certain amount of time will remember what was there.</p>
<p>I cannot speak for anyone else in our town, but our family will always have fond memories of it. Not because it was the closest, or the food, but because of the people who worked there, and the relationships we had with them, even if was only for an hour a week. Some will say it was just a restaurant, but for a long time it wasn’t just that for us. It was an extension of our home.</p>

			 <p>Occasionally, those follow-a-link-from-a-link-from-a-link blog trains land you in a thought pattern that ends up in a situation of &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t I think of this sooner?&rdquo; And so I have arrived at disabling all comments on the blog. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jon Saddington&rsquo;s post<!-- raw HTML omitted --> convinced me to take the plunge, and I even used the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->plug-in<!-- raw HTML omitted --> he suggested. Took less than three minutes. Easy.</p>
<p>Why do this? I don&rsquo;t expect a lot of comments, for one. I don&rsquo;t post often enough for conversations to happen, unlike my friend <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Michael&rsquo;s blog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Second, I don&rsquo;t need another time-wasting distraction that is approving or not approving comments, or going through the ones marked as spam looking for false positives. If there is a need for reader interaction to take place, they can hit me up on any of the major social platforms, or use the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->contact form<!-- raw HTML omitted --> linked at the top of the page. Finally, this blog should be about me writing what I want to write, not writing what I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->think<!-- raw HTML omitted --> people want me to write. Disabling comments helps that focus to happen.</p>
<p>And now I have one less thing to worry about.</p>

Trust me, this location is in <strong>any</strong> GPS app a driver should be using. Meanwhile, a package ordered the same time as that one arrived just fine; courtesy of UPS.</p>

			 <p>Need some help, folks. I’m having trouble remembering the name of a book I read a while back. It&rsquo;s a modern-authored fantasy of the old German Nibelungenlied, Siegfried was the main character, there was this theme of treasure at the bottom of the Rhine running through it, I think there was a dragon&hellip;.it’s killing me that I cannot remember this. Anyone?</p>

<p>I’m not totally killing my Google account and Gmail address, however, as much as I might want to. There is still stuff with Docs and Drive for podcasting collaboration I need to maintain an account for. I do have to think about others in that particular situation. But the Gmail app is coming off devices, too.</p>
<p>I believe this means the only Google apps I&rsquo;m left with are Translate and Waze. I&rsquo;m sure I could find a replacement for the former, but no other app gives me what I need for dealing with Dallas/Fort Worth traffic like Waze does. I&rsquo;d like to be Google-free, but it&rsquo;s just not in the cards as things currently stand. I&rsquo;ll settle for now with this being the best I can do.</p>

			 <p>We hear a lot in the tech press and on personal blogs about bad experiences with Apple&rsquo;s support of it&rsquo;s products, so I thought I would offer a positive experience my family had this past weekend.</p>
<p>A couple of days ago, our teenager&rsquo;s iPhone 7—<!-- raw HTML omitted -->my old iPhone<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and more on that another time—started losing its cellular connection. We could restart the phone, and after a couple of restarts, it would come back up for a few hours before disappearing again. It worked fine on Wi-Fi. When it became apparent that no amount of restarting and resetting networks was going to fix the issue, I made a Genius Bar appointment at one of the DFW metroplex Apple Stores, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Willow Bend in Plano<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I arrived on time for the appointment, and was seen within about three minutes of my arrival by the technician.</p>
<p>I explained to her all the troubleshooting steps we had taken. She ran diagnostics on the phone, then checked the model and serial numbers. This is when she informed me that Apple had become aware of an issue with this particular model of the iPhone 7 a couple of months ago. She shared there was a specific batch from a specific factory that suffered from the cellular modem failing.</p>
<p>Our iPhone 7 is still covered under AppleCare through May. The way she talked about it, however, led me to believe this would be a free repair even if it was not. A $319 repair Apple was eating the cost of for a new logic board, plus labor. When I had the opportunity to ask, I verified this was indeed the case. No matter when one bought the iPhone 7, if it was within this particular batch from that particular factory, you could get a new logic board installed, gratis. The only hitch is that it gets send to one of the repair depots, it&rsquo;s not done in store.</p>
<p>So we were given a loaner iPhone 7. The SIM card was swapped from ours to the loaner, we started an iCloud backup there in the store on Apple&rsquo;s wifi, and that was it. I will get emails about the repair status, plus a call when our iPhone 7 arrives back in the store and is available for pickup. All in all, we were in the Apple Store 45 minutes, and over half of that was spent waiting on the iCloud backup restoration. Kudos to Apple for a job well done in this particular situation.</p>

			 <p>My friends Kara and Ryan, who founded and run <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Imana Kids<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, posted a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->photo<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to the Imana Instagram account with the text of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Isaiah 40:8<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: &ldquo;The grass withers and the flowers fade, but the word of our God stands forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This verse imprinted on me in a most unique way when I was a teenager. Anyone who knows me knows I was a metalhead in my teen years (and I still am). After I discovered Stryper, and the realm of Christian metal, I came across a Christian rock band called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ruscha<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The band was founded by brothers Nikolai and Peter Pankratz, who escaped Communist Russia in the 1970s. They started the band in the 1980s as an outlet for their love of music, and as a vehicle for giving witness to what it was like to be a Christian in Soviet Russia. Andy Denton, whose vocal range is highlighted on the song &ldquo;Come Home&rdquo;, was the group&rsquo;s frontman.</p>
<p>There was a church in one of the Baton Rouge suburbs, Baker or Zachary maybe, I don&rsquo;t recall which, that hosted the band. (It was the same church I also saw Wayne Watson perform at.) My dad went with me to the event, part concert, part testimony. I&rsquo;d gotten their album &ldquo;Come Alive&rdquo; at a local Christian book store, and loved some of the songs. I can still see in my mind&rsquo;s eye Andy, Nikolai, and Peter on stage in that church.</p>
<p>There are two things from that album and concert that have stuck with me to this day:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The memories I just shared, stirred up by the Imana Kids post, sent me on an Internet hunt, and the Internet delivered. There&rsquo;s a Wikipedia entry for the band, linked to earlier in this post. Which led me to wonder if any of their music was available online; the copy of &ldquo;Come Alive&rdquo; I have is on cassette, and most likely buried in a shoebox in a closet. We have an Amazon Music Unlimited subscription, and lo and behold! The Pankratzes released a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->remastered version in 2012<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and I&rsquo;m listening to it as I type this post, with a smile on my face as I sing along to &ldquo;The grass withers, the flowers fade, Heaven and Earth will pass away, the grass withers, the flowers fade, but the Word of God stands forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nathan<!-- raw HTML omitted --> told me that he&rsquo;d read they&rsquo;re taking this a little more linear than the books do, where the timeline jumps back and forth between the past (and multiple characters' pasts) and the present (and multiple characters' presents). I think that will be a benefit. Author Justin Cronin is listed as an executive producer. I&rsquo;m really hoping that means he has real input and it&rsquo;s not just an honorific. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Passage trilogy<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is epic dystopian myth-making. I&rsquo;m actually considering stopping all other reading to pick up the first book again.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a strong adoption theme to the Wolgast/Amy relationship.</p>
<p>I generally give a new show five episodes to keep me as a viewer. Given I read the background material for this one, I&rsquo;m likely already in. I&rsquo;m anxiously awaiting the next episode.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Retrophisch.com<!-- raw HTML omitted --> lives again. I have wandered aimlessly in the wilds of the Internet for far too long. It was finally time to own up to one of my mantras regarding one&rsquo;s online presence: own your own domain, own your own content.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When <!-- raw HTML omitted -->last we left this site<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I had eschewed WordPress for Tumblr. Given one of the constants of life is change, it was only a matter of time before WordPress evolved to the point where I would make the leap. And it was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->so easy<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I wonder why I took so long to do this. (Oh, right, life with three boys, and being hockey dad, Cub Scout dad, swim dad, golf dad&hellip;)</p>
<p>I have had a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dreamhost<!-- raw HTML omitted --> account for a few years. The only real use it had been seeing was serving up email for my oldest, on one of the domains I registered for him a decade or so prior. When the server this blog and its predecessor had been living on suffered a catastrophic hardware failure, it was time to make the move to Dreamhost full time and relaunch. So here we are.</p>
<p>WordPress installation on Dreamhost was a snap with their One-Click Install. Importing my Movable Type archive went seamlessly. Well, seamlessly after I figured out I needed to install and turn on Markdown plugins for some of its and the Tumblr archive&rsquo;s posts to look as they should. Said Tumblr archive followed soon after. My <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tumblr site<!-- raw HTML omitted --> remains up, so long as Tumblr survives as a corporate entity. Should that fail at some point, the posts live on here. Which is the whole point: owning my own content.</p>
<p>Years ago, Michael Hyatt blogged how <!-- raw HTML omitted -->he looked at his online presence as revolving around his blog/site<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. That was home base. Everything else—Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, what have you—were simply outposts. They were never to be one&rsquo;s only online presence. While this resonated with me, having had an online presence before any of these companies came into existence, I stumbled in hewing to it. Nevertheless, thanks to catastrophic hardware failures, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->corporate buyouts<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->creepy corporate policies<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I began anew to prepare myself to giving up one or more of those entities should I feel the need arise.</p>
<p>Manton Reece reiterated, repeatedly, that which Hyatt promoted, and I internalized: own your own content. Manton <!-- raw HTML omitted -->left Twitter in 2012<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but didn&rsquo;t stop with posting tweets. He just did so on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->his own blog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, in the form of snippets, or micro posts. This eventually led him to launch <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Micro.blog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->on Kickstarter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> two years ago. I backed this project, and was among the hundreds of original tenants of the Micro.blog ecosystem. I mainly set it up as the own-my-own-content side of my social media. You&rsquo;d see these same posts on Twitter, Facebook, and elsewhere, but they lived on Micro.blog first. This became my default online presence.</p>
<p>Yet there was still a sense of unease behind it. Yes, it was a service I was paying for. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was the customer, not some corporation paying Manton for all my info so they could sell ads to me. You know, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->exactly<!-- raw HTML omitted --> what Twitter and Facebook do. But it still felt like another layer to deal with. It was better than what I was doing before, and I continue to enjoy the community aspects of Micro.blog, but it didn&rsquo;t feel like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->home<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Now those posts will reside here. I ran into an issue importing my Micro.blog feed, and I&rsquo;m working with Manton to resolve it. Those will cross-post to Micro.blog, and thus to Twitter (and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mastodon<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, for what it&rsquo;s worth).</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still a lot of cleanup to do on the older posts. I&rsquo;ve gotten through 2002 as of this post going up, which means there&rsquo;s a long way to go, but it&rsquo;s worth it to me.</p>
<p>I do not plan to delete old posts. Some of these I&rsquo;ve read and winced. My thinking has changed on some issues in more than a decade since these old posts were published. With others, maybe I could have been nicer and less sarcastic. (Hey, I said maybe.) But they are what they were at that time in my life.</p>
<p>Much thanks is due to Webmistress and CSS master <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Raena<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for assistance in getting things looking just the way I wanted, and to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Michael<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for bits of advice on WordPress, Dreamhost, and importing content.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Because I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->can<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Because I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->want<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to. Because I determined I am going to own my online presence and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not outsource it to others<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. You may not feel this way. That&rsquo;s cool. But this is the way I want it for me.</p>
<p>Own your own domain. Own your own email. Own your own content.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A few years ago, when I was throwing around the idea for a new logo, a new tagline appeared in my mind: Navigating the waters of faith, family, and fiction. While that isn&rsquo;t displayed overtly on the side, it is embedded in the code. So those areas will be my focus, along with the tech and nerdery I&rsquo;ve long been involved with.</p>
<p>In the latter vein, I already have a draft about Mac portables going, based upon some recent experience, recent news, and recent blog posts by others.</p>
<p>I hope you stick around!</p>

			 <p>If you’re still following along on here and paying attention to my little ol’ Tumblog, you’ll note it’s been a few months since I’ve posted. Lots of reasons for that, but here are the two main ones:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I’ve decided to relaunch my original blog at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->retrophisch.com<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, in 2018, for long-form stuff. Short posts will live at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Micro.blog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and be cross-posted to Twitter and Facebook. I’m not posting directly to Instagram any more, either. My online photos will live either on my Micro.blog site, or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Flickr<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, where I have been a paying Pro member for many years.</p>
<p>If we are serious about our online identities, we need a place where we have control of our content. A place either built on open web standards, like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Micro.blog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, or one with easy means of exporting our content for use elsewhere. For me, Tumblr is no longer that place.</p>
<p>I’m not deleting my account or turning this blog invisible. It shall remain up, so long as Tumblr lives, encapsulating my time spent here for the past six years. The custom domain of retrophis.ch I have been using here is going to be repurposed for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my Micro.blog site<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Take care, Tumblrs!</p>
